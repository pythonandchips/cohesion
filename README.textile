h2. Intro

Cohesion is a group of tasks that allow you to check link cohesion in a site.

h2. Installation

h2. Usage

h3. Executable

Running from the command line has the following syntax

h4. Options

Cohesion allows you to control the crawl through various command line options.  These are available through help (see below) and are listed here.

h4. Help

Help with available options is available with --help

bc. cohesion --help




h3. Checking an external site

You can check an external site with the rake task below.  This will crawl the site and check each link within the site, and will also check the links to external sites.  It will also check image, stylesheet and javascript references from link tags.

bc. rake cohesion:check["http://your-site-to-check.com"]

h3. Checking your local development environment

Currently you can check your local development environment the same way as you do an external, but point to your local server:

bc. rake cohesion:check["http://localhost:3000/"]


h2. Future

I intend to add the ability to check the rails app without starting the server though, which would allow you to add it to your specs.

h2. Contribute

If you want to contribute, you can fork the github repository and submit pull requests, or you can donate me some development fuel... ie coffee/beer use this link
