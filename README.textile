h1. Cohesion

h2. Intro

Cohesion is a group of tasks that allow you to check link cohesion in a site.

h2. Installation

Add to your Gemfile

bc. gem 'cohesion'

or you can just install without bundler with

bc. gem install cohesion


h2. Usage

h3. Checking an external site

You can check an external site with the rake task below.  This will crawl the site and check each link within the site, and will also check the links to external sites.  It will also check image, stylesheet and javascript references from link tags.

bc. rake cohesion:check["http://your-site-to-check.com"]

h3. Checking your local development environment

Currently you can check your local development environment the same way as you do an external, but point to your local server:

bc. rake cohesion:check["http://localhost:3000/"]


h2. Future

I intend to add the ability to check the rails app without starting the server though, which would allow you to add it to your specs.

h2. Contribute

If you want to contribute, you can fork the github repository and submit pull requests, or you can donate me some development fuel... ie coffee/beer use this link
